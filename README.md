This is the in-progress repo for gocraft/work rewrite.

## Improvements

- [x] queue backend abstraction
    - redis is still the default, but the new design allows custom queue implementation.
- [x] simplify the keyspace design of redis queue backend
    - The new design uses 1 redis hash per job, and 1 redis sorted set for queue.
    - [Interesting read](https://kirshatrov.com/2018/07/20/redis-job-queue/)
- [x] modular
    - The core only catches panics, retries on failure, and waits if a queue is empty.
    - All other functionalities are either removed or moved to separate middlewares.
- [x] support binary payload/args with message pack.
- [x] replace built-in UI with prometheus metrics (use grafana if you want dashboard).
- [x] additional optimizations (alloc + bulk queue ops)
